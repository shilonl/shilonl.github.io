HiðŸ‘‹, this is Shilong Li. I am currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Software Engineering at the [**University of
California, Irvine**](https://www.uci.edu). During 2023 Summer, I will be joining the team at [**Authentic8,
Inc.**](https://authentic8.com/) as a QA Intern.

In June 2022, I obtained my B.Eng. Degree in Computer Science with honor from the [**Southern University of
Science and Technology (SUSTech)**](https://www.sustech.edu.cn). My coursework and projects have equipped me with a
strong foundation in software development, including experience in programming languages such as Java and Python, and
familiarity with various software development methodologies. I am a quick learner, team player, and dedicated problem
solver, and I am excited to contribute to a dynamic and innovative team.
